# Route Mate

Route Mate is an AR-based indoor navigation system developed as a final-year research project at APIIT Kandy Campus. The system is designed to assist newcomers in navigating large indoor environments such as shopping complexes, educational institutions, and other public buildings. It also considers accessibility for individuals with listening or speaking disabilities, although the system does not provide audio-based assistance.

Route Mate operates using a QR-based navigation workflow, where users scan QR codes placed around the building to retrieve location-specific AR navigation guidance.

## Features
- AR-based indoor navigation
- QR-based location identification
- Multi-floor support with landmarks
- Mobile visualization via Unity (Android)
- Auto-regeneration of Unity system folders on any device
- User-friendly interface

## Project Scope
This implementation is specifically designed for APIIT Kandy Campus but is adaptable to indoor environments such as:
- Shopping malls
- Universities
- Office buildings
- Hospitals
- Public service centers

## Requirements
- Unity 2021 or later
- Android SDK (for Android deployment)
- Mobile device with AR support

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project using Unity Hub.
3. Allow Unity to regenerate the Library, Temp, Logs, and obj folders automatically.
4. Build the project for Android or run it inside the Unity Editor.

## Notes
- The `Library/`, `Temp/`, `Logs/`, and `obj/` folders are excluded from the repository because they are auto-generated by Unity.
- Large assets (>100MB) must be added using Git LFS if required.
